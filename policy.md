## Our Mission

Civic Impulse, LLC builds technology to research and track the federal legislative process. Through our free and open tools, the American public becomes more equipped to participate in our governance.

## Culture & Compliance

### Equal Employment Opportunity Disclosure & Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
We are committed to equal employment opportunity.  We will not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on any legally recognized basis including, but not limited to: veteran status, uniform service member status, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, genetic information or any other protected class under federal, state or local law. We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to qualified individuals with disabilities.  This may include providing reasonable accommodation where appropriate in order for an otherwise qualified individual to perform the essential functions of the job.

### Harassment, Bullying, Violence in the Workplace Policy
We prohibit harassment of one employee by another employee, supervisor or third party for any reason.  Harassment of third parties by our employees is also prohibited.  The purpose of this policy is not to regulate the personal morality of employees.  It is to ensure that in the workplace, no employee harasses another for any reason or in any manner.  Any type of sexual harassment is against company policy and may be unlawful.

### Drug & Alcohol-Free Workplace Statement
The unlawful or improper presence or use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace presents a danger to all employees.  Employees are prohibited from reporting to work or working while using illegal or unauthorized substances.

### Conflict of Interest
A company's reputation for integrity is its most valuable asset and is directly related to the conduct of its employees.  Therefore, employees must never use their positions with the company for private gain, to advance personal interests or to obtain favors or benefits for themselves, member of their families or any other individuals, corporations of business entities.

### Professional Conduct
The company adheres to the highest legal and ethical standards applicable in our business.  The company's business is conducted in strict observance of both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws and the integrity of each employee is of utmost importance.

### Contact with the Media
All media inquiries regarding the company and its operations must be referred to the management.

## Benefits, Compensation, Expenses

### Payroll
Please track your time and submit a time sheet at the end of each pay period. Each time sheet should have a) a row for each day with the total hours worked and a very short list of the tasks accomplished, b) total hours worked in the month, and c) your name and address where the payment should be sent to. 

### Benefits
We do not offer any health, retirement, or other benefits.

### Covered Expenses
We will reimburse pre-approved, work-related expenses typically but not limited to:

* Office supplies.
* Subscriptions and/or software related to your work.
* Travel to, from, and during conferences and events.

## Schedule, Hours & Vacation

### Office Hours, Daily Schedule & Absences

Full time employees are expected to work 40 hours per week (no more than that unless you are making up for another week), minus any vacation and leave time (see below), but we are flexible on where and when that work gets done.

Employees should check in by 11 AM EST each week day with an update of their work plan for the day. Communication is vital to the success of our team; therefore, team members are expected to be reasonably accessible by phone and email between the hours of 11 AMâ€“4 PM.

Employees are able to work from home and/or remotely, as long as they are able to participate in all necessary meetings.

### Vacation & Leave Policy

Our work schedule follows Congress. We are closed on all Federal holidays when Congress is not in session, and other days to be determined.

We expect everyone to be able to get their work done in a timely fashion, and to not have to work on personal time.  Rested and refreshed people are better team members, and we strongly encourage enjoying life outside of our work together. Salaried employees should take a *minimum* of two weeks of paid vacation per year, totaling 10 business days. Hourly-paid employees don't get paid time off but are encouraged to take the same number of vacation days pro-rated --- that's one day off for every 25 days worked. Please work with management to schedule time off.

For personal, medical, or family leave, each employee is encouraged to take the current Family and Medical Leave Act maximum. For maternity and paternity leave, employees are encouraged to take up to 16 weeks of leave.

### Sick Days

Please notify management if you are sick and need to take the day off. When in doubt, err on the side of working from home to avoid spreading illness.
